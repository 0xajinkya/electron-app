Introduction -
A very warm welcome to all of the viewers. This is Ajinkya, speaking on behalf of Team Oppenheimer, I'm excited to introduce you to a project close to our hearts, developed by us as a team.  Over the next few minutes, we'll delve into our innovative solution aimed at enhancing the security of Ubuntu systems.

Problem Statement - 
In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, safeguarding computer systems is of paramount importance. Ubuntu, renowned for its robustness, is no exception but could still benefit from additional layers of security. So, we faced a challenge: How can we develop a solution that automates security tasks effectively while maintaining the integrity of Ubuntu systems?

Solution - 
Our journey led us to a powerful and innovative solution built on a robust tech stack comprising Electron JS, Next JS, Shell, and Node JS. The cornerstone of our solution is a user-friendly application with a very intuitive UI that implements several scripts aimed at hardening the system, which individuals with minimal IT skills can confidently navigate and execute complex security measures. We believe that user experience is paramount, especially in the realm of security, as any barrier to usability can lead to vulnerabilities. Our GUI-based approach transforms the traditionally convoluted process of system hardening into an accessible and straightforward task. It guides users through every step, providing clear explanations and options, allowing them to make informed choices. Security should never be a compromise, and our solution empowers organizations to strengthen their defenses without the need for extensive technical expertise. But we are not plannning to stop at usability. Recognizing that organizations vary in size, structure, and security requirements, we are looking forward to incorporate organization management features. This is where our solution truly shines. Admins are given the tools to create and oversee distinct organizations within the software. They can appoint fellow administrators and invite users to participate in the security-hardening process. These administrators hold the authority to configure and enforce security policies tailored to their organization's unique needs. This flexibility ensures that security measures are aligned with organizational goals while maintaining a robust security posture. Furthermore, we understand that one size doesn't fit all in the world of security. Every organization has its own unique security nuances and requirements. This is where our commitment to flexibility takes center stage. In addition to the predefined hardening functions, we are also planning to offer organizations the capability to integrate custom security scripts. These scripts will empower organizations to go beyond standard hardening procedures, allowing for the creation of security measures that precisely align with their specific needs and policies. We encourage organizations to craft these scripts with the knowledge that our platform serves as a reliable canvas for their security masterpieces.

Prototype -
Let's move from theory to practice. I'd like to present a quick prototype demonstration. As you can see, our GUI-based hardening script streamlines the process, and even those with minimal IT skills can use it effectively. It's designed to make the often daunting task of system hardening straightforward.
